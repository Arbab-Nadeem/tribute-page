					<h2 class="section-headings" >Background</h2>
					Iqbal was born on 9 November 1877 in an ethnic
					Kashmiri family in Sialkot within the Punjab
					Province of British India (now in Pakistan). His
					family was Kashmiri Pandit (of the Sapru clan)
					that converted to Islam in the 15th century and
					which traced its roots back to a south Kashmir
					village in Kulgam.In the 19th century, when the
					Sikh Empire was conquering Kashmir, his
					grandfather's family migrated to Punjab. Iqbal's
					grandfather was an eighth cousin of Sir Tej
					Bahadur Sapru, an important lawyer and freedom
					fighter who would eventually become an admirer of
					Iqbal. Iqbal often mentioned and commemorated his
					Kashmiri lineage in his writings. According to
					scholar Annemarie Schimmel, Iqbal often wrote
					about his being "a son of Kashmiri-Brahmans but
					(being) acquainted with the wisdom of Rumi and
					Tabriz.

				<h2 class="section-headings">Early education</h2>

				Iqbal was four years old when he was sent to a mosque
				to receive instruction in reading the Qur'an. He
				learned the Arabic language from his teacher, Syed Mir
				Hassan, the head of the madrasa and professor of Arabic
				at Scotch Mission College in Sialkot, where he
				matriculated in 1893.He received an Intermediate level
				with the Faculty of Arts diploma in 1895. The same year
				he enrolled at Government College University, where he
				obtained his Bachelor of Arts in philosophy, English
				literature and Arabic in 1897, and won the Khan
				Bahadurddin F.S. Jalaluddin medal as he performed well
				in Arabic. In 1899, he received his Master of Arts
				degree from the same college and won first place in

			<h2 class="section-headings" >Marriages</h2>
			
			<ul id="marriage">
				<li>Iqbal married three times under different
					circumstances. <br />
					first marriage was in 1895 when he was 18 years old.
					His bride, Karim Bibi, was the daughter of a Gujrati
					physician, Khan Bahadur Ata Muhammad Khan. Her sister
					was the mother of director and music composer Khwaja
					Khurshid Anwar. Their families arranged the marriage,
					and the couple had two children; a daughter, Miraj
					Begum (1895–1915), and a son, Aftab Iqbal (1899–1979),
					who became a barrister. Another son is said to have
					died after birth in 1901.</li>
				<li> Iqbal and Karim Bibi
					separated somewhere between 1910 and 1913. Despite
					this, he continued to financially support her till his
					death. Iqbal's second marriage was with Mukhtar Begum,
					and it was held in December 1914, shortly after the
					death of Iqbal's mother the previous November. They had
					a son, but both the mother and son died shortly after
					birth in 1924.</li>
				<li> Later, Iqbal married Sardar Begum, and
					they became the parents of a son, Javed Iqbal
					(1924–2015), who became Senior Justice of the Supreme
					Court of Pakistan, and a daughter, Muneera Bano (born
					1930). One of Muneera's sons is the
					philanthropist-cum-socialite</li>

				Higher education in Europe
			</h2>
			<p>Iqbal was influenced by the teachings of Sir Thomas Arnold, his philosophy teacher at Government College
				Lahore, to pursue higher education in the West. In 1905, he travelled to England for that purpose. While
				already acquainted with Friedrich Nietzsche and Henri Bergson, Iqbal would discover Rumi slightly before
				his departure to England, and he would teach the Masnavi to his friend Swami Rama Tirtha, who in return
				would teach him Sanskrit. Iqbal qualified for a scholarship from Trinity College, University of
				Cambridge, and obtained a Bachelor of Arts in 1906. This B.A. degree in London, made him eligible, to
				practice as an advocate, as it was being practiced those days. In the same year he was called to the bar
				as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn. In 1907, Iqbal moved to Germany to pursue his doctoral studies, and
				earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in 1908. Working
				under the guidance of Friedrich Hommel, Iqbal's doctoral thesis was entitled The Development of
				Metaphysics in Persia.

				In 1907, he had a close friendship with the writer Atiya Fyzee in both Britain and Germany. Atiya would
				later publish their correspondence. While Iqbal was in Heidelberg in 1907, his German professor Emma
				Wegenast taught him about Goethe's Faust, Heine and Nietzsche.He mastered German in three months.
				During his study in Europe, Iqbal began to write poetry in Persian. He preferred to write in this
				language because doing so made it easier to express his thoughts. He would write continuously in Persian
				throughout his life</p>
